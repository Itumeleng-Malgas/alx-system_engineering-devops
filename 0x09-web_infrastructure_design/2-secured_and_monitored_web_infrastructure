# What are firewalls for

Firewalls are a fundamental component of network security and play a crucial role in safeguarding
systems and data from a wide range of cyber threats, including unauthorized access, malware,
denial-of-service attacks, and data exfiltration. They are used in both personal and enterprise settings
to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network resources.

# Why is the traffic served over HTTPS

HTTPS is crucial for ensuring the security, privacy, and integrity of data transmitted over the internet.
It has become the standard for websites and web applications, helping to protect users and data from a wide
range of online threats. It's a fundamental component of online security and trustworthiness.

# What monitoring is used for

crucial for maintaining the reliability, security, and performance of IT infrastructure and services. 
Monitoring can help organizations proactively address issues, optimize resource utilization, and ensure a
seamless user experience.

# How the monitoring tool is collecting data

The choice of data collection methods depends on the specific monitoring needs, the type of infrastructure being monitored,and the capabilities of the monitoring tool being used.
	* Agent-Based Monitoring
	* SNMP-Based Monitoring
	* Log and Event Data Collection
	* API and Web Services Integration
	* Packet Capture and Analysis
	* Remote Probing and Synthetic Transactions

# Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server Query Per Second (QPS)

Install monitoring tool on a dedicated server or a machine separate from your web server.
Configure the monitoring tool to collect QPS data from your web server.

# Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue

If the load balancer is compromised, there is a risk of SSL keys and decrypted data being exposed.
This could potentially be a more significant security risk than if SSL termination was done on the
application servers.

# Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If there's only one MySQL server that can accept write operations,
it becomes a single point of failure. Any hardware or software issues that affect this server can lead
to downtime and data loss. Hardware failures, database corruption, or even routine maintenance can
disrupt your services.

# Why having servers with all the same components
# (database, web server and application server) might be a problem

Lack of Scalability: All-in-one servers may not be able to handle increased load efficiently. For example,
if you need to scale your web servers to accommodate more traffic, you'll have to scale your database and
application servers as well, even if they don't need the extra resources. This can be costly and inefficient.
